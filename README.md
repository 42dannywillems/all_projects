# Project list

This repository contains the list of all 42 projects I realize.

* [libft](https://github.com/42dannywillems/42_libft): implementation of a part
  of the standard C library with data structures.
* [get_next_line](https://github.com/42dannywillems/42_get.next.line): C
  function to read a line from a file descriptor. We can't use FILE structure,
  we need to reimplement it.
* [OCaml pool](https://github.com/42dannywillems/Piscine.OCaml): OCaml pool.
  Introduction to functional paradigm with OCaml language.
